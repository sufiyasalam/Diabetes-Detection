## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Flask
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- TensorFlow (if using .h5 model)
- HTML/CSS for frontend design

## Installation

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Diabetes Detection
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## How to Use the Application

1. Input your health data in the provided fields.
2. Click on the "Submit" button to see the results.
3. The application will display whether you are diabetic or not along with relevant metrics.

## Training the Model

To train the model from scratch, run the `train_model.py` script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate the model files (`diabetes_detection_model.h5` and `rf_model.pkl`) used by the application.
